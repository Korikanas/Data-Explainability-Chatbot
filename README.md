# Data Explainability Chatbot

Developed as my final-year B.Tech project, this chatbot provides explainability for machine learning and deep learning models by generating natural language explanations of model predictions.  
It integrates state-of-the-art XAI (Explainable AI) techniques to enhance trust, interpretability, and transparency in AI systems.
